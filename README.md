- 👋 Hi, I’m @PostSupe
- 👀 I’m interested in tech that makes Post Production (particularly film production, online, post, and delivery) better, and also on a personal level in interactive Art installations with delightful audio and visual impact.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to extend my existing maker knowledge (mostly Arduino art/control) into some more day-job related skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tolls to help storytellers... but I'm starting with some tools to control ptojectors, ha!
- 📫 How to reach me... hmmm, I'm a bit of a private netizen, but I'll share what I can here!
